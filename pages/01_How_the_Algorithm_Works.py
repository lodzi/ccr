The CCR Algorithm evaluates cultural creativity and relevance by balancing *craft, timing, and ethical sensitivity*.
Each score (1â€“5) is normalized (0â€“100), passed through a concave scaling function, weighted, boosted for timeliness, and reduced for cultural risks.

**Key features:**
- **12 dimensions** of creativity and cultural fit
- **Concave scaling** to reward above-average work more than mediocre work
- **Risk penalties** for stereotypes, appropriation, or negative sentiment
- **Light de-biasing** across raters for fairness
- **Output:** a single **CCR Score (0â€“100%)** indicating cultural creativity & relevance
