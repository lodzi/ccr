### Transparency and Methodology

The Culturally Creative & Relevant (CCR) Algorithm measures the creative and cultural value of campaigns in a transparent, data-informed way.  
It combines quantitative structure with qualitative judgment, translating expert assessment into a single percentage score.

### Scoring Process

Each campaign is evaluated across the 12 dimensions on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high).  
The algorithm then applies several steps to produce a consistent and interpretable CCR Score.

1. **Normalization**  
   Convert all 1â€“5 ratings into a 0â€“100 range.

2. **Concave Scaling**  
   A mild non-linear curve (gamma = 0.85) rewards outstanding work exponentially more than average work.

3. **Weighting**  
   Multiply each scaled dimension by its corresponding weight from the table above.

4. **Timeliness Boost**  
   Campaigns strongly aligned with cultural or social timing can receive up to an 8% bonus.

5. **Risk Penalty**  
   Deductions are applied for problematic or insensitive aspects:
   - -3 points per ethical/cultural flag  
   - -4 additional if two or more flags apply  
   - -12 Ã— (estimated negative sentiment ratio)

6. **Final CCR Score**  
   All values are summed, adjusted for boosts and penalties, and then clamped between 0 and 100.  
   The result represents the campaignâ€™s **Cultural Creativity & Relevance** percentage.

### Version and Improvement

This framework is a living system. It will evolve through dialogue, data, and collective feedback.  
If you believe the weighting should shift, or that new dimensions should be considered, you are welcome to share suggestions.
